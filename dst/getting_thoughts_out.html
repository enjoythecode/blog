            <h1 id="how-should-i-get-thoughts-off-my-head">How Should I Get Thoughts Off My Head?</h1>
            <p>My brain is constantly producing random thoughts and ideas. If I do not focus on some physical sensation (in other words, meditate), this makes me prone to zoning out and leads to inaction.</p>
            <p>Simply getting thought out of my head (which I’ll simply refer to as <em>expression</em>) to some form of <strong>physical medium</strong> is the best remedy I’ve found for this. After coming to this realization, I wanted to consider my options for doing so and their pros and cons. The 3 options I tested were; 1. Writing (with pen on paper) 1. Typing (with a Moonlander using the Colemak layout) 1. Speaking (assuming that I can have my speech dictated if I speak at a level that is a little faster than my regular conversation speed.)</p>
            <p>I tested the <em>speed of expression</em> in all of these by transcribing a section from Marie Kondo’s book in 2 minutes, and converted that to a WPM score.</p>
            <h2 id="writing">Writing</h2>
            <p>This seemed like the perfect approach to me on paper (<em>haha</em>). It is fast, requires almost no technology, is discreet and socially acceptable almost everywhere, mobile, easy, and cheap.</p>
            <p>Well, at least I thought that writing was fast. However, to my surprise, I write at <strong>40 words per minute</strong>. This is quite the dissappointment to me, considering how much I like the tactile feeling.</p>
            <h3 id="pros-of-writing">Pros of Writing</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Discreet</li>
            <li>Can be done anywhere</li>
            <li>Minimal fixed cost; easy to jot down thoughts</li>
            <li>Tactile feeling of pen and paper is hard to beat</li>
            <li>Can evolve into scribbling, not constrained by technologys ### Cons of Writing</li>
            <li>Slow</li>
            <li>Can not use computers to search it without additional effort</li>
            <li>Information might be lost</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="typing">Typing</h2>
            <p>I might be a little unfair to typing here because I’m still learning Colemak, however I know my past top speed with QWERTY as well, so it is not that big of a deal. The biggest benefit of typing to me is that everything I write down is immediately searchable. I am not sure how much I actually used my typed up notes (hint: very, very rarely), so this might be deluding myself. The problem of typing is that it is not easily accessible everywhere, even with mobile phones.</p>
            <h3 id="pros-of-typing">Pros of Typing</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>Full-text search</li>
            <li>Discreet</li>
            <li>You can back up all data ### Cons of Typing</li>
            <li>Slow. I typed at roughly <strong>45 wpm</strong> during my test, and typing this up is taking pain-stakingly long. I could reach ~100wpm with sufficient practice, probably!</li>
            </ul>
            <h2 id="speaking-and-having-the-computer-dictate-it">Speaking (and having the computer dictate it)</h2>
            <p>This is the option that I’m most passionate about because I haven’t considered it before I’m actually writing this usingdictation that is built into the Microsoft OS right now and it seems to be pretty good the best part of it is that it’s really fast but I did my test I did it in about roughly 200 words per minute and right now typing thisI guess dictating it is very fastand I have already written roughly suelines within what feels like 10 seconds so I really like thatI’m guessing that one negative of this will be that I will need to go back in and add in punctuation and perhaps edit some words but it seems like for Englishit is catching the words pretty accurately and it’s also able to catch up with my speed roughly even though it is askingfor me to slow down enough periods to catch up but that’s OK because I can always stop to think.</p>
            <p>Wow, keyboard me again. That was blazing fast. Like, at least by a factor of 5. I’m blown away by how fast this thing is, and I love that it has most of the benefits of my text being on the computer.</p>
            <p>Hi so this is speaking me again and right now my brain is absolutely rushing with ideas how how I could use this dictation technology to absolutelyrevolution allies how I take notes and write so this is absolutely very fast and it worksa really nicely for I’m actually understanding my words so I’m thinking of actually fine tuning my system to make it work really greatly for me because this is just literally the built in windows OS and that’s unnecessarily the best option that I could potentially make it even fasterfor UM say zettle casting or Obsidianand similar softwares by using themcode and I know that there’s at least one open source project that lets you scriptsinto the dictation outputs of the words you say so mymy my brings out silly running with ideas</p>
            <p>So two thoughts here one of them is that I don’t actually mind a stream of consciousness output and I think it could be optimizedif it’s something else as I said because all I care about is that I did get the things I get thoughts of my head off my head and that it is searchable I don’t mind the extra output because I rarely if evergo back and look at these So what matters is the relevant keywords are dictated cordon correctly and I can search by them on second thought is how do I actually make this useful for Obsidian what I’m thinking of is that I need to be able to go back in the paragraph I just dictate itand link specificwords or phrases or let’s say make specificphrases into words now I could do that with keyboard and mouse and it’s going to work fine for 90% of the use case but if I wanted to I could also optimize itby as I said using that specific scripting ability to define some custom keywords that I’m unlikely to use in regular speech and make those be have those be.</p>
            <p>Hello hello I’m imagining it’s super futuristicsystem where it combines by tracking with speech dictation where the AI can be used as a super fast and I’m gonna make cursor and speech dictation removes the need for using your hands to type this is this will be superhey komicsuper fast to write down your thoughts and you would likely be able to use our entire computer without ever really needing to use your keyboard or mouse you will be able to simply operate it withyour face and that is super cool you will be able to get some simple tasks done such as reading responding to emails and writing down thoughts for example in a blog or a journal I love that</p>
            <p>One more thing I’m noticing is that how much the media we write in affects our outputs simply because this is such an easy way to write out my my thoughts I am speaking so much more and as I get to thoughts off my head I can think more I guessor I’m less blocked in my files so I can let everything out so much faster so it’s actually has such a high productivity effort effect in that I can’t I am writing so much more simply because I changed how I express my thoughtson the computer and that’s absolutely brilliant mosttechniques or tips online are actually ******** and you won’t be able to find any you’ll be very lucky to find something that improves your performance or productivity by 10% without putting any working and this is absolutelyskyrocketing how much I put out onto the computer and I’m absolutely loving it I believe this will be able this will give me the ability tojust think and write down the result of those thoughts so much better I’m super glad I discovered this and I thinkthis is here to stay</p>
            <p>Just to finish it off I’m going to write down the thoughts that the pros and cons of thisthe pros are it’s really really fast it is blazing fast and I’m just going to add this as another probecause it is so fast it also helps with my productivity in that I how much IGet down in that how much I write down so much morethe other Pro is that it is very easy and it is ergonomic in that I’m not using my hands and so it’s super easy on my brain I could technically be just like stretching or moving around or padding around my computer and still writing this down and it would work really welland the fact that I have my body free to me and not gettingSouth can soreness and potential injury with RSI is brilliantnow for the cons I’m going to admit that speaking a lot is going to be it’s going to be loud and if you have….you literally speaking your Your cows out loudso this is not going to be discrete also the software and the mic quality might mess up with the dictation quality right now I’m seeing multiple errors so maybe my initial excitement Is a little bitof a hype rather than actual benefit but I am absolutely loving how much I’ve dictated simply because I’m speaking.</p>
            <p>Overall this is great.</p>
            <h1 id="answer">Answer</h1>
            <p>It is definitely speaking unless I’m in a situation where misspeaking is not feasible either due to me being loud or me wanting to be discreet in those cases writing seems to be the option to go with unless somehow i need to need to put the inf….r example if i need to write an email.</p>
            <p>challenging your assumptions can lead….ou do life and that’s really valuable</p>
            <p>At this point, the Microsoft software couldn’t keep up with my speed and started erroring out. This might be due to the online nature of tool. In either case. I’d be exploring my options beyond the “generic” option. I can’t wait to find a system that works for me, there is already so much promise in voice input.</p>
