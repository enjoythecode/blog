<h1>Don't Open Your Umbrella Right Away</h1>

<p>Don't open your umbrella right away when it starts raining. There is joy in getting a little wet. It might not even rain that much.</p>

<p>Don't open your phone right away when you get a little bored. Your brain will find something to tinker with, and that will be more interesting than your social media feed, I promise.</p>

<p>Don't open the food delivery app when you get a little hungry. Your brain confuses thirst with hunger, drink some water. Your body benefits from some fasting, look up autophagy. Stay a little hungry so that you can appreciate the abundance of food.</p>

<p>Don't rush to online shopping when you get an urge to purchase some item. Give the decision a few days. Most of these urges are irrational and will go away in a few days. You'll then have more money for stuff that will actually nourish your needs.</p>

<p>Recognize when getting a little wet can be fun.</p>
