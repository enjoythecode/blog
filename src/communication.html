# Thoughts on Good Communication

Clear, succinct communication is ideal. Being able to communicate clearly requires work, and it is beneficial to both parties.

Writing is a great format for succinct communication because it allows for both the writer and the reader to iterate over the prose. This iteration nurtures communication skills and deepens understanding for both.

Benefits of communicating clearly to the writer:
- Clear expression requires a solid understanding. Expressing ideas unambiguously exposes gaps in understanding to the writer.
- Concise prose fully exposes ideas. There isn't ambiguity that could deflect criticism. This accelerates constructive criticism, nurtures confidence, filters half-assed work.
- Clear writing allows your personality to shine through your prose, and the ability to communicate well a fine addition to your personality.

Benefits of clear communication to the reader:
- Concise prose allows deep focus and true comprehension. Reading clear prose is conducive to the state of flow.
- Clear ideas are adaptable to your perspective and therefore are actionable.
- Succinct prose signals respect to the readers' time and attention.

Most of these benefits require back-and-forth communication. If you're reading this, I ask you to respond. If you are a writer, I encourage you to seek feedback.
