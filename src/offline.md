# Go Offline Default

My electronic devices are connected to the internet throughout the day. That is just the way they are, that is what I'm used to. That is the default.

Being online brings distractions. Sure, it is easy to turn on "Do Not Disturb" to prevent the notifications from email, social media, and instant messaging. Being online doesn't just expose you to distractions from notifications. It also makes it much easier to switch away to some other app whenever you are bored.

Being online means you can easily open any website within 5 seconds of getting distracted. If you ever get distracted it is *so easy* to find something to fill your boredom. If you were offline by default, switching away would require you to conciously turn on the wi-fi and wait for it to connect.

That is a significant amount of friction, which has three main benefits:

- You consume less distractions, since it is harder to do so

- You **become aware** of your urges for distraction

- If you decide to actually switch away, it is a **concious decision**, rather than just muscle memory.

I encourage you to try going offline by default. Only connect to the internet when you absolutely need to. Find alternatives for SaaS applications so that you can deeply focus on your work, isolated from the tempting distractions of the internet. [Don't be afraid to get a little wet.](umbrella.html)
