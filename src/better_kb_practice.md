# How Can We Improve Keyboard Practice Tools?
I've been learning the Colemak layout in the past few weeks, and I've used a few tools to practice my speed & accuracy such as monkeytype, keybr, typeracer.

One thing I've noticed is that all these record your overall WPM (words per minute), and keybr also helpfully keeps track of your accuracy and speed *per character*. 

Keybr will also increase the frequencies of the characters that you are new at, or that you are relatively slow/inaccurate at. That is really useful, which is why I've used keybr the most when learning Colemak. 

However, I think we can go one step further with the same idelogy, and apply the same technique for words themselves. It is no surprise that the English language has some really common words, or groups of two or three letter (called bigrams and trigrams, respectively). Committing these patterns into muscle memory is a major aid for typing speed, and all modern keyboard layouts (Dvorak, Colemak, Workman) optimize the placement of the characters for the ease of writing these groups. So, explicitly practicing these groups, and tracking metrics *per 'token'* would be a great help, similar to how useful keybr has been in my Colemak practice.

Currently, I'm just getting this idea out on my blog. I'd love prototype something along these times when I can allocate time to it.
