# World's Largest Cow Sculpture

I was searching for the world's largest animal sculpture today (do *not* ask my why), and I came across the Guinness World Records claiming that 


I was looking for the largest animal sculpture
Guinness claims that it was made in Germany my Milka, and that it was 14meters (46ft) tall.
I could NOT find any pictures or other evidence of it, which is insane to me

I did find this other "World's Largest Cow" (unofficial) in North Dakota. It is supposedly 38ft tall, meaning it is 20% smaller than the one Guinness is claiming. (and look at those small people!)
so, kinda sus that I can't find anything about the supposed official world record, but I am happy to see that ND was at it again
